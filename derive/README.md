# Proc Macros for `mimicry`

This crate provides procedural macros for [`mimicry`], allowing for lightweight
mocking / spying.

## Usage

The crate macros are re-exported from the main crate, so it rarely makes sense to
use it as a direct dependency.

See `mimicry` readme and crate docs for the examples of usage.
